# Pre-Workshop Exercises

This folder contains exercises that we intend for you to attempt before attending
the workshop. There are two exercises, found in two R Markdown notebooks:

* `pre_workshop_01_pop-projection_solutions.Rmd` - an introduction to Leslie matrices and population projection, which will be discussed in more detail on Monday and Tuesday of the workshop
* `pre_workshop_02_replacement_migration.Rmd` - an introduction to some of the datasets and ideas that will form the basis of our Replacement Migration activities on Wednesday of the workshop

We recommend that you complete the exercises in this order.

Please attempt these exercises before attending the workshop!
We will have Zoom office hours to help discuss these exercises before the workshop starts.
We will also send a Google Form that will allow you to submit answers to selected questions
from these two exercises. The letter you receive by email will have more details.
